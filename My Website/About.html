<h1>Solomon Outdoors</h1>

<h2>About me</h2>
<per>Hello, My name is Solomon Canney, I was born and raised in Helena Montana and I love
the ourdoors! I have 5 siblings and loving parents, I am a father to my amazing son Zephaniah
and husband to my beautiful wife Faith. I spend most my time in classes, work, and church, but
in my free time I try my best to get outside! The ourdoors are a wonderful way to reconnect
with the maker and see the beauty He has to offer. Part of the outdoors that has such an allure
is all of the incredible animals littering the earth. I love animals, which might be confusing
since I do stalk and kill them, but there will be more on that in the <a href="facts.html">Facts</a> page. But I assure
you I am deeply fascinated and full of respect for the animals of the earth. However, my deepest
reverence goes to GOd the Father above who breathed the mountains into existence but chose to sculpt
me and you from the clay of the earth to be in His image and to know Him and be known by Him. </per>
