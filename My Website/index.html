<h1>Solomon Outdoors</h1>

<h2>Hunting</h2>
<per>Hunting has always been a passion of mine, I enjoy being outside in God's
creation, chasing after the wonderful wildlife my home state Montana, has to offer.
I love hunting because, it provides me with lots of food, I am able to get away from
the business of life and schedules, I get to connect with wildlife and nature, and I
love the amount of skill and effort it takes to harvest and animal in it's natural habitat</per>

<h2>Fishing</h2>
<per>Fishing has also been a big passion of my life. I do all sorts of fishing, fishing from
the shore, fishing on a kayak, fishing in the water, fishing with a fly rod, fishing with a
bobber and much more. My favorite fishing is when I hike into an alpine lake deep into the woods
and fish small mountain lakes that hardly ever get fished. I love the feeling of being away from
everything and everyone and just being outside peacfully enjoying what God has given us to enjoy.</per>
